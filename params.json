Is that even a term? =))\r\n- The idea was to initially be free of the grid and just have cells with relations, but that didn't quite pan out\r\n- Performance is very slow, but the code can be useful as a study example, I guess.\r\n\r\nThe starting grid is randomized and R resets the \"game\", space moves forward an iteration.\r\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/574921/6877118/444ae2aa-d4ce-11e4-8923-ec8940697fe1.png)","google":"UA-61323022-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
